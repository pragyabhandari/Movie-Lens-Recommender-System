    "# Model-Based Collaborating Filtering\n",
    "Memory based algorithms are easy to implement and produce reasonable quality of prediction. However, they don't reall align with the real world scenarios as they don't perform well in situations where a new user is added to the data base. Model-based CF is better under such circumstances but suffer in case a user has no ratings. The goal of MF is to learn the latent preferences of users and the latent attributes of items from known ratings (learn features that describe the characteristics of ratings) to then predict the unknown ratings through the dot product of the latent features of users and items. When you have a very sparse matrix, with a lot of dimensions, by doing matrix factorization you can restructure the user-item matrix into low-rank structure, and you can represent the matrix by the multiplication of two low-rank matrices, where the rows contain the latent vector. You fit this matrix to approximate your original matrix, as closely as possible, by multiplying the low-rank matrices together, which fills in the entries missing in the original matrix."

    "To give an example of the learned latent preferences of the users and items: let's say for the MovieLens dataset you have the following information: (user id, age, location, gender, movie id, director, actor, language, year, rating). By applying matrix factorization the model learns that important user features are age group (under 10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-90), location and gender, and for movie features it learns that decade, director and actor are most important. Now if you look into the information you have stored, there is no such feature as the decade, but the model can learn on its own. The important aspect is that the CF model only uses data (user_id, movie_id, rating) to learn the latent features. If there is little data available model-based CF model will predict poorly, since it will be more difficult to learn the latent features.\n",

Hybrid recommender systems usually show higher accuracy than Collaborative Filtering or Content-based Models on their own: they are capable to address the cold-start problem better since if you don't have any ratings for a user or an item you could use the metadata from the user or item to make a prediction."
